# Songreq.me

## About
Songreq provides an easy way to allow rudimentary collaborative playlisting by suggesting songs to an admin (DJ).  It also strives to be a good open source example of an [Angular2](https://angular.io/) / [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) web app.  I'm building it to learn the new Angular2 framework and iron out a reference setup to use for future projects, and perhaps other people can do the same.
